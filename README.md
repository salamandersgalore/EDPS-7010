# EDPS-7010
#### Sam Dutton

### The purpose of this repository is to provide you with the R code necessary to perform the variety of statistical tests and visualizations needed for EDPS 7010. Labs will be uploaded after their respective due dates; class examples will be uploaded as soon as I am able to pop them on here!

### If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to either leave a comment on the code in Github or email me at the email address listed in your syllabus. I will be more than happy to provide support on your R journey!
